1)
- To make a virtual environment - virtualenv clickbait-env
- To activate virtual environment - clickbait\Scripts\activate

2) To install dependencies -  
	pip install jupyter numpy scipy scikit-learn
	(jupyter is optional)
3) Save the clickbait.txt file in project directory.

4) Clickbait headlines - 1
   Normal headlines	   - 0

5) Vectorizer - transforms text to numerical format
	* TfidfVectorizer is used here
	* TF-IDF = Term frequency - Inverse Document Frequency
	* Each piece of text is converted to large sparse array(most elements are 0)
	Each element in the array represents how often a specific word occurs in the headline.

	* Assumption - All the words in the dataset make up the Universal set.

	* Words occuring very often(and,the,is) - are given low weights
	* Words occuring less frequently - higher weight and considered important.

6) strip() - removes whitespace characters from start and end of the string

7) Converting text to vectors - 
	* "fit" the vectorizer - look at all unique words and decide the number of features(=no. of unique words)
	*  "transform" - converts into matrix of vectors
